🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection System
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a Python-based application designed to monitor a driver's alertness and detect signs of drowsiness. This system uses real-time video feed from a camera to analyze the driver's facial features and detect eye movement and blinking patterns to determine drowsiness. The system raises an alert if the driver is deemed to be falling asleep or getting drowsy, improving road safety.

🌟 Highlights
🎯 Real-Time Detection - Monitors the driver’s face and eyes continuously
🎯 Alert System - Triggers an alarm when drowsiness is detected
🎯 Eye Blink Monitoring - Tracks blink rate and eye closure to assess fatigue
🎯 Face Detection - Uses OpenCV for face detection
🎯 User-Friendly Interface - Visual feedback of detection status

🛠️ Tech Stack
🔹 Python - Main programming language for implementing the system
🔹 OpenCV - For face and eye detection in video frames
🔹 Dlib - For facial landmark detection to monitor eye closure
🔹 TensorFlow (optional) - For enhanced machine learning models (if applicable)
🔹 Pygame (optional) - For sound or visual alerts
